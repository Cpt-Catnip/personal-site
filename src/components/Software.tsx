        <p>
          I&apos;m a fullstack software engineer currently working at Morgan
          &amp; Morgan. My software journey began in earnest the summer of 2020
          when I enrolled in Fullstack Academy&apos;s full-time web development
          immersive bootcamp. In reality I&apos;ve been writing code since 2014
          when I first learned Matlab in <i>Math and Computational Physics</i>{' '}
          while studying physics at Skidmore.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughtout my physics and engineering education, I regularly had to
          use tools like Matlab, Python, and Wolfram Mathematica to help solve
          complicated, highly technical problems. I even took a course on Java
          at one point! So even though I&apos;ve only been writing
          &quot;software&quot; since 2020, I&apos;ve really been coding since
          2014!
        </p>

          Come back soon for a look at some of my software projects and
          experience. Until then, feel free to check out my{' '}
